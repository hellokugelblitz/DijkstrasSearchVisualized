You can create your own dynamic graph with as many nodes as you'd like.

## Controls
* **Click** to add nodes.
* **Hold shift** and drag to move them. 
* **Click and drag** to create edges.
* **Use the control panel** to handle specific actions.

* Bug Fixing
..* There are some occasional issues with the weighted graph functionality, need to pin that down.
